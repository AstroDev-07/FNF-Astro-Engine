<p>Hello there! My names Astro, a novice-ish game developer and YouTuber.</p>
<br>
<p>I Frequently play a game some of you might know as 'Friday Night Funkin'</p>
<br>
<p>Recently i decided i'd create my own custom engine using Unity for it! and since i want somewhere to show update logs, i decided i'd use github!</p>
<br>
<p>In short, this repo will be used for progress updates with the only file here, whenever i release a build to play it will be on a itch page or my own website im not sure yet, source code will be here though, or a dev build if you wanna call it that.</p>
<br>
<p>So yeah, thanks for checking out the repo!</p>
